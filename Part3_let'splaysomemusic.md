# Epitech Discord Bot Workshop - Part 03

## Warning
Make sure you've installed the `ydl-core`, `@discord.js/opus` and `ffmpeg-static` npm packages for this part.  
Please refer to [**Part 0**](Part0_installandsetup.md) for the installation process.

## Let's play some music

So now that you know how to handle events and create commands let's do something *actually* useful.

Let's create a **music bot**!

This part is a bit more challenging than part 1 and part 2 but it's also the best one !

1) You need your bot to check if the user that send the command `!play [URL TO YOUTUBE VIDEO]` is in a Voice channel.
If not send a reply that explain why the command didn't work.
1) Try to play some local music in the voice channel.
1) Use ytdl-core to play the url given as a parameter in the voice channel.
1) Try to add some `filter` to the youtube video so even with a bad connection on your computer it will work.

Once you've done this, congratulations!  
The journey has been amazing, and we hope you liked it!  
You're now ready to develop amazing bots :)

If you want to continue your music bot, here are some cool stuff you could do:
* Volume command
* Queue system (skip to next, display queue, ...)
* *And so on*

Thank you again, have a wonderful day/night!
